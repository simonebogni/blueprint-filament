## Intro

FilamentPHP provides a collection of beautiful full-stack components to build pages.\
This is often use to create admin panels and dashboards.\
But it can be used to build customer-facing apps, SaaS and much more.

It has easy-to-use tools to build and customize panels, forms, tables and widgets.\
It allows to customize notifications, actions.

It uses Laravel Livewire behind the scenes, so creating custom components is extremely easy.

At the time of writing, the latest version is 3.1.20.

The documentation can be found here: https://filamentphp.com/docs \
The GitHub repository is this one: https://github.com/filamentphp/filament

## Requirements

Filament requires:

- PHP 8.1+
- Laravel v10.0+
- Livewire v3.0+

Filament builds upon many core Laravel concepts, especially database migrations and Eloquent ORM.\
Therefore, developers approaching Filament should already be familiar with Laravel.\
If this is not the case, the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x) official website and the [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/) website offer perfect documentation and courses.\
I specifically recommend the following free courses:

- [Laravel 8 from scratch](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch) - a complete course that covers all the topics. Duration: 9h 48m.
- [What's new in Laravel 9](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9) - a course to bring you up to speed to the changes from Laravel 8 to 9. Duration: 44m.
- [What's new in Laravel 10](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-10) - a course to bring you up to speed to the changes from Laravel 9 to 10. Duration: 37m.
